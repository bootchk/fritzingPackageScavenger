Utility application for Fritzing.
Scavenges a new SMD package for a part in the "Mystery SMD" family.
Scavenge means it searches existing SMD packages for compatible packages (desired number of pads, etc.)

GUI for choosing the number of connectors (pins or pads) and the SMD package you want to scavenge.

"Mystery SMD" means the breadboard and schematic images will be abstract.
But the PCB SMD land pattern image will be real.

Experimental and fragile.  Hardcoded directories means it only works for Fritzing 7.7b installed in user home on Linux.
(But you can change the program in a few places to make it work for your installation.)

Work in progress. See TODO in the file fritzingPackageScavenger.py.

Also, it creates a .fzp file in ~/.config/Fritzing/parts/user.
The package doesn't appear in Fritzing unless you already have a "Mystery SMD" part.
And you may need to restart Fritzing.
Or you may need to search for the part e.g. using "SMD" search phrase.
